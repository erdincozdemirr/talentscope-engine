# TalentScope Engine

**TalentScope** is a phrase-aware, explainable CV–Job matching and candidate ranking engine designed for
transparent, domain-specific, and salary-aware hiring decisions.

TalentScope is **not** a traditional resume scanner.  
It is a **decision-support engine** that aligns CVs with job descriptions using canonical skill
normalization, phrase-first matching, and domain-aware scoring — producing auditable, API-ready JSON outputs.

The system is designed from day one to be exposed via **FastAPI**, enabling CV ingestion, salary data
management, job description uploads, and ranked candidate retrieval through REST APIs.

## ✨ Core Capabilities

### 🔍 Phrase-First Skill Matching
- Multi-word phrases (e.g. **“Spring Cloud Gateway”**) are matched before tokens.
- Prevents incorrect scoring from partial matches (`gateway` alone does not score).

### 🧠 Canonical Normalization & Synonyms
- Multiple spellings map to a single canonical skill:
  - `spring boot` ≈ `springboot` ≈ `spring_boot`
  - `ASP.NET Core` ≈ `.NET Core`
- Canonical definitions are centralized in `skills.yaml`.

### 🛡️ Boundary-Safe Matching
- Regex word-boundary based matching prevents false positives:
  - `java` ≠ `javascript`
  - `sql` ≠ `postgresql`
- Underscore (`_`) is treated as a word character, supporting CV styles like `spring_boot`.

### 🎯 Job-Driven Domain Scoring
- Job descriptions determine **which domains are evaluated**.
- CVs are scored **only for domains relevant to the selected job**.

### 📊 Transparent & Explainable Scoring
- Every score is deterministic and explainable.
- Output includes:
  - matched skills
  - missing skills
  - per-domain scores
  - overall CV score

### 💰 Salary-Aware Candidate Ranking
- Supports:
  - fixed salary expectations
  - salary ranges (e.g. 80k–90k)
- Uses midpoint calculation: salary_mid = (min + max) / 2

- Ranking favors:
1. Higher job-fit score
2. Higher overall CV score
3. Lower salary expectation

## 🧩 What TalentScope Is (and Is Not)

### ✅ What it is
- Explainable CV–Job matching engine
- Deterministic, auditable, and rule-based
- Designed for backend & enterprise HR systems

### ❌ What it is not
- Not a black-box ML system
- Not dependent on labeled training data
- Not a keyword counter

🚦 Threshold Logic

Candidates with: job_fit_score < 75%  are automatically rejected.

Only candidates relevant to the selected job domain are returned.

⭐ Final Note

TalentScope is built on the principle that hiring systems must be transparent, fair, and controllable.
It is designed to scale from a local engine to a production-grade API-driven hiring platform.
